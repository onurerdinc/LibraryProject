# Project 1: Triple Peaks Library

Welcome to my first-ever project, a fictional library landing page! This simple yet elegant webpage features a variety of sections designed to showcase the different offerings of the library. Each section is thoughtfully crafted to provide an engaging and informative user experience. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on a design brief.
